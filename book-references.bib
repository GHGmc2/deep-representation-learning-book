  unsupervised learning and in deep architectures for transfer learning and
    other tasks. In spite of their fundamental role, only linear autoencoders
    over the real numbers have been solved analytically. Here we present
    a general mathematical framework for the study of both linear and non-linear
    autoencoders. The framework allows one to derive an analytical treatment for
    the most non-linear autoencoder, the Boolean autoencoder. Learning in the
    Boolean autoencoder is equivalent to a clustering problem that can be solved
    in polynomial time when the number of clusters is small and becomes NP
    complete when the number of clusters is large. The framework sheds light on
    the different kinds of autoencoders, their learning complexity, their
    horizontal and vertical composability in deep architectures, their critical
    points, and their fundamental connections to clustering, Hebbian learning,
  and information theory.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2011 International

ABSTRACT = {This work proposes a new computational framework for learning a structured generative model for real-world datasets. In particular, we propose to learn a Closed-loop Transcriptionbetween a multi-class, multi-dimensional data distribution and a Linear discriminative representation (CTRL) in the feature space that consists of multiple independent multi-dimensional linear subspaces. In particular, we argue that the optimal encoding and decoding mappings sought can be formulated as a two-player minimax game between the encoder and decoderfor the learned representation. A natural utility function for this game is the so-called rate reduction, a simple information-theoretic measure for distances between mixtures of subspace-like Gaussians in the feature space. Our formulation draws inspiration from closed-loop error feedback from control systems and avoids expensive evaluating and minimizing of approximated distances between arbitrary distributions in either the data space or the feature space. To a large extent, this new formulation unifies the concepts and benefits of Auto-Encoding and GAN and naturally extends them to the settings of learning a both discriminative and generative representation for multi-class and multi-dimensional real-world data. Our extensive experiments on many benchmark imagery datasets demonstrate tremendous potential of this new closed-loop formulation: under fair comparison, visual quality of the learned decoder and classification performance of the encoder is competitive and arguably better than existing methods based on GAN, VAE, or a combination of both. Unlike existing generative models, the so-learned features of the multiple classes are structured instead of hidden: different classes are explicitly mapped onto corresponding independent principal subspaces in the feature space, and diverse visual attributes within each class are modeled by the independent principal components within each subspace.},

abstract = {In deep learning, models typically reuse the same parameters for all inputs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models defy this and instead select different parameters for each incoming example. The result is a sparsely-activated model--with an outrageous number of parameters--but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs, and training instability. We address these with the introduction of the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques mitigate the instabilities, and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the first time, with lower precision (bfloat16) formats. We design models based off T5-Base and T5-Large (Raffel et al., 2019) to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter models on the "Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus", and achieve a 4x speedup over the T5-XXL model.},

It then uses a set of generative weights to convert the code vector into an approximate reconstruction of the input vector. We derive an objective function for training autoencoders based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. The aim is to minimize the information required to describe both the code vector and the reconstruction error. We show that this information is minimized by choosing code vectors stochastically according to a Boltzmann distribution, where the generative weights define the energy of each possible code vector given the input vector. Unfortunately, if the code vectors use distributed representations, it is exponentially expensive to compute this Boltzmann distribution because it involves all possible code vectors. We show that the recognition weights of an autoencoder can be used to compute an approximation to the Boltzmann distribution and that this approximation gives an upper bound on the description length. Even when this bound is poor, it can be used as a Lyapunov function for learning both the generative and the recognition weights. We demonstrate that this approach can be used to learn factorial codes.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems}, pages = {3–10}, numpages = {8}, location = {Denver, Colorado}, series = {NIPS'93} }

abstract = {We consider the problem of learning discriminative representations for data in a high-dimensional space with distribution supported on or around multiple low-dimensional linear subspaces. That is, we wish to compute a linear injective map of the data such that the features lie on multiple orthogonal subspaces. Instead of solving this learning problem using multiple instances of principal component analysis (PCA), we cast it as a sequential game using the closed-loop transcription (CTRL) framework recently proposed for learning discriminative and generative representations for general low-dimensional submanifolds. We prove that the equilibrium solutions to the game indeed give the correct representations. Our approach unifies classical methods of learning subspaces with modern machine learning practice, by showing that subspace learning problems may be provably solved using the modern toolkit of representation learning. In addition, our work provides the first theoretical justification for the CTRL framework in the important special case of linear subspaces. We support our theoretical findings with compelling empirical evidence. We also generalize the sequential game formulation to more general representation learning problems. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.}

  abstract = 	 {A central problem in machine learning involves modeling complex data-sets using highly flexible families of probability distributions in which learning, sampling, inference, and evaluation are still analytically or computationally tractable. Here, we develop an approach that simultaneously achieves both flexibility and tractability. The essential idea, inspired by non-equilibrium statistical physics, is to systematically and slowly destroy structure in a data distribution through an iterative forward diffusion process. We then learn a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly flexible and tractable generative model of the data. This approach allows us to rapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative models with thousands of layers or time steps, as well as to compute conditional and posterior probabilities under the learned model. We additionally release an open source reference implementation of the algorithm.}

abstract = {The significantly expanded and updated new edition of a widely used text on reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence. Reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence, is a computational approach to learning whereby an agent tries to maximize the total amount of reward it receives while interacting with a complex, uncertain environment. In Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the field's key ideas and algorithms. This second edition has been significantly expanded and updated, presenting new topics and updating coverage of other topics. Like the first edition, this second edition focuses on core online learning algorithms, with the more mathematical material set off in shaded boxes. Part I covers as much of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. Many algorithms presented in this part are new to the second edition, including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning. Part II extends these ideas to function approximation, with new sections on such topics as artificial neural networks and the Fourier basis, and offers expanded treatment of off-policy learning and policy-gradient methods. Part III has new chapters on reinforcement learning's relationships to psychology and neuroscience, as well as an updated case-studies chapter including AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Atari game playing, and IBM Watson's wagering strategy. The final chapter discusses the future societal impacts of reinforcement learning.}

  abstract = 	 {This paper proposes an unsupervised method for learning a unified representation that serves both discriminative and generative purposes. While most existing unsupervised learning approaches focus on a representation for only one of these two goals, we show that a unified representation can enjoy the mutual benefits of having both. Such a representation is attainable by generalizing the recently proposed closed-loop transcription framework, known as CTRL, to the unsupervised setting. This entails solving a constrained maximin game over a rate reduction objective that expands features of all samples while compressing features of augmentations of each sample. Through this process, we see discriminative low-dimensional structures emerge in the resulting representations.  Under comparable experimental conditions and network complexities, we demonstrate that these structured representations enable classification performance close to state-of-the-art unsupervised discriminative representations, and conditionally generated image quality significantly higher than that of state-of-the-art unsupervised generative models.}

 abstract = {This is the classic work upon which modern-day game theory is based. What began more than sixty years ago as a modest proposal that a mathematician and an economist write a short paper together blossomed, in 1944, when Princeton University Press publishedTheory of Games and Economic Behavior. In it, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new field of scientific inquiry it yielded--game theory--has since been widely used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. And it is today established throughout both the social sciences and a wide range of other sciences.This sixtieth anniversary edition includes not only the original text but also an introduction by Harold Kuhn, an afterword by Ariel Rubinstein, and reviews and articles on the book that appeared at the time of its original publication in theNew York Times, ttheAmerican Economic Review, and a variety of other publications. Together, these writings provide readers a matchless opportunity to more fully appreciate a work whose influence will yet resound for generations to come.},

abstract = {From the Author's IntroductionSince I am neither a neurologist nor a psychiatrist, but a mathematician, the work that follows requires some explanation and justification. It is an approach toward the understanding of the nervous system from the mathematician's point of view. However, this statement must immediately be qualified in both of its essential parts.First, it is an overstatement to describe what I am attempting here as an "approach toward the understanding"; it is merely a somewhat systematized set of speculations as to how such an approach ought to be made. That is, I am trying to guess which of the---mathematically guided--lines of attack seem, from the hazy distance in which we see most of theme a priori promising, and which ones have the opposite appearance. I will also offer some rationalizations of these guesses.Second, the "mathematician's point of view," as I would like to have it understood in this contexts carries a distribution of emphases that differs from the usual one: apart from the stress on the general mathematical techniques, the logical and the statistical aspects will be in the foreground. Furthermore, logics and statistics should be primarily, although not exclusively, viewed as the basic tools of "information theory." Also, that body of experience which has grown up around the planning, evaluating, and coding of complicated logical and mathematical automata will be the focus of much of this information theory. The most typical, but not the only, such automata are, of course, the large electronic computing machines.Let me note, in passing, that it would be very satisfactory if one could talk about a "theory" of such automata. Regrettably, what at this moment exists---and to what I must appeal--can as yet be described only as an imperfectly articulated and hardly formalized "body of experience."Lastly, my main aim is actually to bring out a rather different aspect of the matter. I suspect that a deeper mathematical study of the nervous system --"mathematical" in the sense outlined above--- will affect our understanding of the aspects of mathematics itself that are involved. In fact, it may alter the way in which we look on mathematics and logics proper. I will try to explain my reasons for this belief later.}

abstract="In this paper, we show how to harness both low-rank and sparse structures in regular or near regular textures for image completion. Our method leverages the new convex optimization for low-rank and sparse signal recovery and can automatically correctly repair the global structure of a corrupted texture, even without precise information about the regions to be completed. Through extensive simulations, we show our method can complete and repair textures corrupted by errors with both random and contiguous supports better than existing low-rank matrix recovery methods. Through experimental comparisons with existing image completion systems (such as Photoshop) our method demonstrate significant advantage over local patch based texture synthesis techniques in dealing with large corruption, non-uniform texture, and large perspective deformation.",

We start by studying the statistics of natural images including the scale invariant properties, then generic prior models were learned to duplicate the observed statistics, based on the minimax entropy theory studied in two previous papers. The resulting Gibbs distributions have potentials of the form $Uleft( {{schmi{bf I}};,Lambda ,,S} right)=sumnolimits_{alpha =1}^K {sumnolimits_{ left( {x,y} right)} {lambda ^{left( alpha right)}}}left( {left( {F^{left( alpha right)}*{schmi{bf I}}} right)left( {x,y} right)} right)$ with S = {F(1), F(2), ..., F(K)} being a set of filters and = { (1)(), (2)(), ..., (K)()} the potential functions. The learned Gibbs distributions confirm and improve the form of existing prior models such as line-process, but, in contrast to all previous models, inverted potentials (i.e., (x) decreasing as a function of |x|) were found to be necessary. We find that the partial differential equations given by gradient descent on U(I; , S) are essentially reaction-diffusion equations, where the usual energy terms produce anisotropic diffusion, while the inverted energy terms produce reaction associated with pattern formation, enhancing preferred image features. We illustrate how these models can be used for texture pattern rendering, denoising, image enhancement, and clutter removal by careful choice of both prior and data models of this type, incorporating the appropriate features.}, journal = {IEEE Trans.

Alongside this approach, there is an analysis counterpart model, which, despite its similarity to the synthesis alternative, is markedly different. Surprisingly, the analysis model did not get a similar attention, and its understanding today is shallow and partial. In this paper we take a closer look at the analysis approach, better define it as a generative model for signals, and contrast it with the synthesis one. This work proposes effective pursuit methods that aim to solve inverse problems regularized with the analysis-model prior, accompanied by a preliminary theoretical study of their performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the analysis model in several experiments, and provide a detailed study of the model associated with the 2D finite difference analysis operator, a close cousin of the TV norm."

In practice, we show that a single model learns photographic noise removal, denoising synthetic Monte Carlo images, and reconstruction of undersampled MRI scans - all corrupted by different processes - based on noisy data only.}

  abstract = 	 {Sparse coding is a basic task in many fields including signal processing, neuroscience and machine learning where the goal is to learn a basis that enables a sparse representation of a given set of data, if one exists. Its standard formulation is as a non-convex optimization problem which is solved in practice by heuristics based on alternating minimization.  Recent work has resulted in several algorithms for sparse coding with provable guarantees, but somewhat surprisingly these are outperformed by the simple alternating minimization heuristics. Here we give a general framework for understanding alternating minimization which we leverage to analyze existing heuristics and to design new ones also with provable guarantees. Some of these algorithms seem implementable on simple neural architectures, which was the original motivation of Olshausen and Field in introducing sparse coding. We also give the first efficient algorithm for sparse coding that works almost up to the information theoretic limit for sparse recovery on incoherent dictionaries. All previous algorithms that approached or surpassed this limit run in time exponential in some natural parameter. Finally, our algorithms improve upon the sample complexity of existing approaches. We believe that our analysis framework will have applications in other settings where simple iterative algorithms are used}

abstract = {We consider the problem of building high-level, class-specific feature detectors from only unlabeled data. For example, is it possible to learn a face detector using only unlabeled images using unlabeled images? To answer this, we train a 9-layered locally connected sparse autoencoder with pooling and local contrast normalization on a large dataset of images (the model has 1 billion connections, the dataset has 10 million 200\texttimes{}200 pixel images downloaded from the Internet). We train this network using model parallelism and asynchronous SGD on a cluster with 1,000 machines (16,000 cores) for three days. Contrary to what appears to be a widely-held intuition, our experimental results reveal that it is possible to train a face detector without having to label images as containing a face or not. Control experiments show that this feature detector is robust not only to translation but also to scaling and out-of-plane rotation. We also find that the same network is sensitive to other high-level concepts such as cat faces and human bodies. Starting with these learned features, we trained our network to obtain 15.8\% accuracy in recognizing 20,000 object categories from ImageNet, a leap of 70\% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.},
