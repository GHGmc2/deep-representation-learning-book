          paragraphs: [
            'In the current era of deep learning and especially "generative artificial intelligence", there is significant investment in training very large generative models. Thus far, such models have been "black boxes" that are difficult to understand in the sense that they have opaque internal mechanisms, leading to difficulties in interpretability, reliability, and control. Naturally, this lack of understanding has led to both hype and fear.',
            'This book is an attempt to "open the black box" and understand the mechanisms of large deep networks, through the perspective of representation learning, which is a major factor --- arguably the single most important one --- in the empirical power of deep learning models. A brief outline of this book is as follows. Chapter 1 will summarize the threads that underlie the whole text. Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5 will explain the design principles of modern neural network architectures through optimization and information theory, reducing the process of architecture development (long having been described as a sort of "alchemy") to undergraduate-level linear algebra and calculus exercises once the underlying principles are introduced. Chapters 6 and 7 will discuss applications of these principles to solve problems in more paradigmatic ways, obtaining new methods and models which are efficient, interpretable, and controllable by design, and yet no less --- sometimes even more --- powerful than the black-box models they resemble. Chapter 8 will discuss potential future directions for deep learning, the role of representation learning, as well as some open problems.',
            'This book is intended for older undergraduate students, or initial graduate students, who have some background in linear algebra, probability, and machine learning. This book should be suitable as a first course in deep learning for mathematically-minded students, but it may help to have some initial surface-level knowledge of deep learning to better appreciate the perspectives and techniques discussed in the book.',
            'Due to the timeliness of the book, and the prevalence that deep learning already has and may continue to have in the future, we have decided to make the book completely open-source. We will update it regularly to improve the presentation of the material and reflect advances in the field, and welcome contributions from subject matter experts about relevant topics that we may have missed. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ma-Lab-Berkeley/deep-representation-learning-book). If you feel that something is missing or can be improved, you can [let us know](https://github.com/Ma-Lab-Berkeley/deep-representation-learning-book?tab=readme-ov-file#raising-an-issue) or [contribute it yourself](https://github.com/Ma-Lab-Berkeley/deep-representation-learning-book#making-a-contribution). We will work to keep a similar standard of quality for new contributions, and recognize contributions in [the contributors page](contributors.html).'
